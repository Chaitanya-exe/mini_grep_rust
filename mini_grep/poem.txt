I’m in the zone, just me and my code,
Building solutions, the algorithms I load.
Debugging my path, no room for despair,
Loops and conditions, my logic is rare.

From frontend vibes to backend might,
I deploy my dreams in the server’s light.
In the world of dev, I’m the architect king,
Crafting the future, let the syntax sing!
